# Can i use your core client for my mods?
Yes, just do not rip or embed the client into your mod.
To do so include it in your refrences and disable "Copy Local"
ClientCore.Extras has most features, but anything in ClientCore is ok to use (just don't claim it as your own nor give the dlls away)
*For a full list of script extensions on core, please read "Extensions.cs" that show examples of each function*

# Changelog
**0.0.1**
 Client Core:
  - Edits Home and Notification tabs to look similar to other mod tabs
  - VRCPlus shows even when you dont have it
  - Infobar on the bottom is now pinned to the top
