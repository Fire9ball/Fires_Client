# Can i use your core client for my mods?
Yes, just do not rip or embed the client into your mod.
To do so include it in your refrences and disable "Copy Local"
ClientCore.Extras has most features, but anything in ClientCore is ok to use (just don't claim it as your own nor give my client dlls away)
